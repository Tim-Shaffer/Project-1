# Description - 
 * Travel with the Team allows the Avid Sports Fan the ability to present to a significant other, or friend, good reasons to take a vacation in a location where they can also take in a game by also presenting some other activities they may also be able to do on the same trip!

# Motivation - 
* Problem:  *A sports fan wanting to travel to a different city to watch a game and wanting to bring his/her significant other along who is not as much of a sports fan.  They really want to go watch a game, but have to convince the other party it would be a good trip.*

* Solution: **Travel with the Team** - has the ability to present other event/activity options to the non sports fan to make the case that the trip would be entertaining for all.
    
# Results - 
* A working app that shows a particular teams next 10 games and allows the user to select a game to gather 20 other activities that are going on in the same city that the game will be played.
* User can select a different game if the activity choices aren't enough to convince the other party.

# Improvements -
1. Allow the user to select a different team without having to restart the app process.
1. Better scroll to the activity section upon selecting a game to go watch.
1. Allow user to limit the activities to specific types to help narrow down the lists.
1. Allow for more than 20 activities to be shown, 20 at a time in some fashion.
1. Allow a link to the event for further description.
1. Updated presentation to be more team centric including possibly a logo display throughout.
1. Ability to "tag" activities and print a possible itinerary.
1. Links to allow user to get tickets to the game and other activities.

## Team Efforts -
* During the preliminary design phase, each member voted for what piece they wanted to work on directly.
    * Matt was most comfortable with the HTML and CSS so he wanted to concentrate his efforts there.
    * Nancy was comfortable doing an API call so we decided to have her concentrate on the events API
    * I wanted to learn more about the API process and decided to work with the Game API.

## My Individual Responsibilities -
* Pulling on my experience as a Team Leader along with source control best practices, I volunteered to play a Team Lead role to help make things run as smooth as possible and hopefully avoid some of the GitHub 'gotchas' that could occur while trying to coordinate code updates.
* Having the most available time to work on the product, I lent a hand to each team member when needed, either through coaching, pair programming, or acting as a Scrum Master to keep everyone on task.

## Challenges -
* Lack of experience within the team in proper source control flow and process created an early issue with a merge that I had to debug and resolve.
* Good code structure and commenting was an issue and I tried to keep pieces as updated as possible when merging changes back into my own branch so the final push to the master branch would be as easy as possible.
* Focusing on the smaller picture and getting a task completed before adding enhancements.  I tried to keep the tasks simple and manage the project as best I could with issues and project tools on GitHub.  
* Coordination of schedules and what needed to be done by when.  I offered pair programming support to Nancy as we came down to the wire and needed to get the event API call working.
* GitHub - the lack of experience and not understanding the need for good commit messages led to some issues in making sure changes were getting merged appropriately.  Matt acknowledged not totally understanding the Git flow and was not making sure to keep updating his branches with changes committed to the Master branch.  I did my best to try and keep his branches up to date with diff and merge processing but some changes were missed along the way and not put into the working product.
